Insertion and/or deletion at the beginning of the head is O(1) //only the head pointer needs to be updated

Insertion and/or deletion at the end (tail) is a O(n) due to the fact you need to traverse through the entire linked list to find the second to last node

Pointers:

Linked lists are linked due to the fact they have pointers connecting them all together

node is a space of contiguous memory, the building block of a linked list

Each node has two parts
    -self.data: stores the actual value
    -self.next: a reference, a pointer
