Three types of ways to traverse a DFS

1. Pre-order
    -From the top, going down and then from left to right
2. In-order
    - Left side heavy and then parent then child, then up, reapeat process
3. Post-order  
    - From the bottom, but can only traverse of what has been processed
    - Need to visit all children before being processed
